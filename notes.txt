Prop drilling is a common pattern in React where data is passed down from a parent component to a deeply nested child component through intermediate components. Content component receives three props: items, handleCheck, and handleDelete (Content.jsx ln3)

Content is a component that receives props from its parent component (Script.jsx).

It depends on the data and functions provided through these props to render its content and handle user interactions.
Script Component.

In Script.jsx, we are rendering the Content component and passing it three props: items, handleCheck, and handleDelete.

Prop drilling occurs here as Script is responsible for providing these props, and they are drilled down to the Content component.
