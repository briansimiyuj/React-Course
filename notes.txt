Default props allow us to specify default values for a component's props in case they are not provided when the component is used. They ensure that our component still functions correctly even if certain props are missing. 

We can define default props using the `defaultProps` property within a functional component (Header.jsx ln16). This is particularly useful for creating more robust and flexible components that gracefully handle various input scenarios. Default props help make our code more predictable and maintainable by defining fallback values when needed.
